Lawvolution
-----------

Evolution of various German laws as if the Parliament were using git.


Notes
-----
- <zitstelle> is the very first publication of this law, not the current change. The current change can probably be found by regexing on <standkommentar> which always starts of after the latest "Neufassung"
- Once the BGBl is found, we can find more details by searching for it on http://dipbt.bundestag.de/dip21.web/searchProcedures/advanced_search_list.do?selId=238517&method=select&offset=0&anzahl=100&sort=3&direction=desc . There we can find all proceedings concerning whatever ended up being published at that particular BGBl citation. 
- It seems as if only named votes are published in an easy format. If there is not a named voted, the result is only mentioned in writing in the proceedings. Would have been nice to get a resolution along party lines, but I guess that would be quickly imprecise and is thus not published.
- The results of named votes can be found at: https://www.bundestag.de/parlament/plenum/abstimmung/liste
